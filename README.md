# Arudino-Due-Arbitrary-Waveform-Generator
Arbitrary waves can be drawn, edited, saved, opened and uploaded to the Due via USB, or the Due can run alone, controlled by pots &amp; switches.

Note: 
The DueArbitraryWaveformGeneratorController32.rar file is intended for 32 bit systems, but often works better on 64 bit systems as well (since the ...64.rar file doesn't have java embedded).
